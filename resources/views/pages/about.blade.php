                    Welcome to my UniGuide website "Admin Portal", In the modern academic environment, students often face difficulties in planning their 
university attending events, tracking upcoming workshops or volunteer events, and making informed
decisions about their next attend. This portal aims to develop a digital platform that
simplifies planning, organizing and provides
information about university activities.
